- [x] Reduces confidence
- [x] Causes stress
- [x] Prevents effective service

**On Business:**

## Opportunity Mapping

### RM Priority Hierarchy

| Priority | Goal | Weight in Product Design |
|----------|------|-------------------------|
| **#1** | Retain existing customers | Highest - features should surface retention signals first |
| **#2** | Grow existing relationships | High - balance, credit, product adoption opportunities |
| **#3** | Acquire new customers | Lower - secondary, often separate roles |

---

### Opportunity 1: Early Risk Detection

| Field | Value |

| **Product Features** | B-05 (Primacy Risk Alerts), B-15 (Competitive Intelligence Alerts), CC-05 (At-Risk Alert) |
| **Pillar** | Recommendation |
| **RM Priority Alignment** | #1 Retention |
| **Priority** | P0 |

---

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Opportunity ID** | OPP-02 |
| **Pain Addressed** | "Where is there real growth potential, not just noise?" |

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Opportunity ID** | OPP-04 |
