# Banker Persona Template
## Template for Consistent Persona Development Across PM Team

**Purpose:** Use this template to **document** what you learned from interviews. This is the **output structure** where you organize insights after conducting interviews using the `Banker_Interview_Guide.md`.

**When to use this:**
- ✅ **After** you complete an interview (to document findings)
- ✅ **While** comparing multiple interviews (to find patterns)
- ✅ **Before** product planning (to reference user needs)

**What this is NOT:**
- ❌ Not the interview questions (use `Banker_Interview_Guide.md` for that)
- ❌ Not a questionnaire (it's an organization framework)

**How it works:**
1. Use `Banker_Interview_Guide.md` **during** the interview to ask questions
2. Use this **Persona Template** **after** the interview to structure your notes
3. Fill in each section based on what you learned from the interview

# Documented Persona: Commercial Relationship Manager

*Source: Research conversation, December 2025*

## Priority Hierarchy (Non-Negotiable)

Commercial RMs have a clear priority order:

| Priority | Goal | Importance |
|----------|------|------------|
| **#1** | **Retain existing customers** | Non-negotiable. Losing a good commercial client is a failure. |
| **#2** | **Grow existing relationships** | Increase balances, credit usage, product adoption. Main way to hit targets. |
| **#3** | **Acquire new customers** | Important but secondary. Often supported by separate hunting roles. |

## Core Insight

> **"RMs do not lack motivation. They lack signal clarity."**

This is the fundamental problem we're solving.

## What RMs Struggle With

RMs struggle to answer three questions:
1. **Which customers need attention right now?**
2. **Who is quietly disengaging?**
3. **Where is there real growth potential, not just noise?**

**Root cause:** They are overloaded and reactive.

## What We Should Build (MVP Framework)

| Capability | Description | Aligns to Priority |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Detect early signs of risk** | Use real financial and engagement behavior to spot weakening relationships before churn | #1 Retention |
| **Identify growth moments** | Concrete signals: increased cash, credit usage shifts, lifecycle changes. Not generic upsell. | #2 Growth |
| **Turn signals into clear actions** | Not dashboards. Simple guidance: who to call, why, and what to discuss. | All |
| **Align to RM KPIs** | Retention first. Growth second. Acquisition only where relevant. | All |

## Feature Mapping

| Backlog ID | Feature | Maps to RM Need |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| B-05 | Primacy Risk Alerts | Detect early signs of risk |
| B-07 | Deposit Consolidation Detector | Identify growth moments |
| B-14 | Proactive Outreach Triggers | Identify growth moments |
| B-17 | Daily Call Sheet | Turn signals into actions |
| B-04 | Next-Best-Action Recommendations | Turn signals into actions |
| B-18 | Conversation Starters | Turn signals into actions |
| BUD-02 | Priority Customer Identification | All three |

## Primacy Indicators Connection

The 40+ Primacy Indicators are the signal engine that answers the three RM questions:
- **Disengagement signals:** Deposit behavior, competitive leakage, engagement patterns
- **Growth signals:** External deposits, credit usage shifts, consolidation opportunities
- **Attention signals:** PRISM score changes, transaction flow anomalies
